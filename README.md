Hi!

This task has been a big learning curve for me.

I made a point to try complete this homework without any help. 

I definitely made way more commits than I probably should have done - mainly down to going back and forth and switching around with probably not much structure ... but if I had to complete a task like this again, I think I'd be able to get through it much quicker and with less amendments / commits. The back end amendments probably look quite messy - but I just wanted to give it a real shot without asking for help.

I've created a 3 page website of 'About', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact' and I've tried to make it look as much like the example as possible, but with my own little twist. I'd definitely do 1 commit per 1 change moving forward rather than adding 2 - 3 changes to 1 commit! 

Here is my URL:

Here are my commits:

Add files: Creating all my files
Basic HTML body: Just adding the basic HTML 
Import bootstrap: Importing bootstrap to my HTML
Nav bar: Adding nav bar to all pages
Change of nav bar: An amendment to that
Add footer and stylesheet: Adding footer to all pages and creating CSS stylesheet
Add main element: Adding a main element to all pages
Background colour: Adding a bgc to CSS
Amend background colour: Changing bgc in CSS
Add comments + form to contact page: Adding some HTML comments and adding a form to contact page
Add grid: Adding bootstrap grid to all pages
Changed to sticky footer: Changing my footer to a sticky footer
Further HTML comments: Adding more HTML comments
Google fonts header: Importing Google fonts to amend headers on pages
Stylesheet CSS comments: Adding CSS comments
Tidy up layout: Tidying up the layout of pages
Nav bar items to right: Fixing nav bar elements to right of page
Portfolio content: Adding portfolio card and content
Portfolio page content finish: Finishing that content
Index page content: Adding content card to index page
Style contact form: Adding CSS 
Organise files + add comments: Restructuring my files and adding final comments to HTML and CSS
Links: Making sure nav bar links work
Fix contact form responsive: Making sure contact form was responsive 

Moving on from that was just commiting my read me file and doing some final bits! 

Thanks.
